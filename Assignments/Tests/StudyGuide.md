- 3 Central Principles of OOP
  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
- Define: 
	- Abstraction
	- Class
	- Object
	- Method
	- Abstraction
	  - https://stackify.com/oop-concept-abstraction/
	- Encapsulation
	- Polymorphism
	- Overloading
	  - [basic_overloading.cpp](https://github.com/rugbyprof/2143-Object-Oriented-Programming/blob/master/Resources/Test-1-StudyGuide/basic_overloading.cpp)
	- Attributes / Properties
	- Class Variable
	- Instance Variable
	- Class variables versus instance variables
	     - Class variables are declared in the class definition using the [static]( http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_static_members.htm) keyword prefix.
	     - While each instance of a class has its own copy of instance variables, all instances of a class share the same single copy of class variables.
  - Class methods versus instance methods
     - Class methods are declared in the class definition using the static keyword prefix.
     - Class methods are not associated with any specific instance. As a result, note that the built-in identifier this is not declared in class methods, and instance variables cannot be accessed inside a class method unless the access is qualified using a specific instance of the class.
  - Member Variable
  - Inheritance

  - Multiple Inheritance 
  - Composition


-----

Write a class called `Rectangle` that would allow a user to:
 - set the width
 - set the height
 - set the width and height
 - calculate the area

----

Write a function to build a 2 dimensional array of type`Rectangle` 

----

Write a class definition called `RectangleWorld` that manages a 2D world of rectangles. Your class should have the following functionality:
- Return the area of a rectangle specified by row and column.
- Return the total area of all rectangles.
- Update the width and or height of a rectangle.
- Update the width and or height of all rectangles.
-----

Implement any one of the methods here.
