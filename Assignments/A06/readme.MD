## Assignment 6 - Bouncing Screen Saver Clock

### Overview:

Using the starter code included [here](./clock_starter) or using your own Assignment 05, write a clock class that extends / inherits from `Group` and `sfml::drawable` so you can easily print your clock to a game screen. There are plenty of examples in the [Resources](../../Resources) folder for you to follow. 

### Some Additions:

- Your clock will be paired with a rectangle to serve as it's background. 
- Since your clock will extend group, your clock text and rectangle can be printed together.
- Make your clock configurable. This means there should be methods for changing:
    - Font color
    - Font size
    - Background color
    - Border color
    - Clock position
- Make your clock(s) have a movement feature that will allow it to float around the screen bouncing off the walls.

### Deliverables:

- Turn in a copy of your completely commented code at the beginning of class.
- The name of your `cpp` file should be `clocks.cpp`.
- Make sure your code makes it onto github in your assignments folder under a folder called `A06`.
- Along with your code, your folder should contain 1 animated gif of your clocks running.
- Name your gif `clocks.gif`.
