## Counter Class - Creating a counter for our game
#### Due: Friday November 2<sup>nd</sup> by classtime.

### Overview:

Write a class that uses the SFML `Clock` and `Time` classes to create us a counter class. Your class will allow a user to do the following:

- Start a timer.
- Reset a timer.
- Set a length of time to run.
- Allow your timer to count up to some value (or have no ending time).
- Allow your timer to count down to some value (or have no ending time).
- For this class assume the user wants to display only discrete seconds (1,2,3) not (1.23,1.24,1.25.....,2.0)
- When your timer is finished, it will close the sfml window.
- The example below prints to stdout but you can print your timer text to the sfml window.
