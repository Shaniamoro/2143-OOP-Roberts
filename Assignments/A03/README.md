Definitions 

Class 
	A class is logical grouping of attributes(variables) and
	methods(functions)
Object
	This is the basic unit of object oriented programming.
	Object is an instance of a class that has access to all the
	attributes and methods of that class
Method
	A function within a class that performs a speciﬁc action is called
	 a method belonging to that class.Methods are of two types: static
	 method and instance method
****Abstraction
	Abstraction is the process of steps followed to achieve
	encapsulation.providing only essential information to the outside world 
	and hiding their background details,
	Example: For example, a database system hides certain details of how 
	data is stored and created and maintained. 
****Encapsulation
	Encapsulation is placing the data and the functions that work on that 
	data in the same place. While working with procedural languages, it is 
	not always clear which functions work on which variables but object-oriented
	 programming provides you framework to place the data and the relevant 
	functions together in the same object.
	Hiding the implementation details from the end user is called
	as encapsulation
Polymorphism
	The same interface existing in different forms is called
	polymorphism.
	The ability to use an operator or function in different ways in other
	 words giving different meaning or functions to the operators or functions
	 is called polymorphism. Poly refers to many. That is a single function or
	 an operator functioning in many ways different upon the usage is called 
	polymorphism.
 	Example :
 	An addition between two integers 2 + 2 return 4
	whereas an addition between two strings "Hello" + "World"
	concatenates it to "Hello World"

Overloading (Operator)
	Redefining how an operator operates its operands is called
	operator overloading.
	When the exiting operator or function is made to operate on 
	new data type, it is said to be overloaded.
Attributes / Properties
	Data members are attributes declared within a class. They are properties 
	that further deﬁne a class.   There are two types of attributes: class 
	attributes and instance attributes	  
Class Variable
	An attribute that is common across all instances of a 
	class is called a class attribute.
	Because they are owned by the class itself, class variables are shared by all instances
	 of the class. They therefore will generally have the same value for every 
	instance unless you are using the class variable to initialize a variable.
Instance Variable
	An attribute that is speciﬁc to each instance of a class is called an 
	instance attribute.
	This means that for each object or instance of a class, the instance 
	variables are different.
Member Variable
	 a member variable is a variable that is associated with a specific object,
         and is accessible for all its methods.It must be declared within a class, 
	but not within the body of a method of the class. 
Inheritance
	 Inheriting the attributes and methods of a base class into a
	 derived class is called Inheritance.
	 is the process of forming a new class from an existing class that is from the
	 existing class called as base class, new class is formed called as derived class.
	 it helps to reduce the code size since you can reuse existing code with little to no 
	modification.
Multiple Inheritance
	 Mechanism in which a derived class inherits from two or more
	 base classes is called a multiple inheritance
Composition
	This process of building complex objects from simpler ones is called object composition.
	Relationship between objects where one object owns or has the other object 
	think of the phrase "Has a" 
	a car has a body ; a car has an engine ; a car has wheels
